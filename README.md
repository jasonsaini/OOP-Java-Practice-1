# OOP-Java-Practice-1

This repo holds a collection of my favorite Java exercises from How to Program Early Objects 11th edition!
I used these exercises not only to get better at object oriented programming but to learn UML diagrams, unit testing and continous deployment!

### Some of the highlights are:

#### Password generator - ex37
#### Password Strength indicator - ex25
#### Magic 8 Ball - ex33
#### Anagram detector -ex24
