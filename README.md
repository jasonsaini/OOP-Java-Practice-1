# OOP-Java-Practice-1

This repo holds a collection of my favorite Java exercises from How to Program Early Objects 11th edition.
These exercises helped me learn the object oriented paradigm, UML diagramming, version control with Git, and unit testing in JUnit 5!

### These are my favorites:
- Password generator - ex37
- Password Strength indicator - ex25
- Magic 8 Ball - ex33
- Anagram detector -ex24
